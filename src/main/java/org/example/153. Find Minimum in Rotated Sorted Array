153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


import java.util.*;

public class tUf {
    public static int findMin(int []arr) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            //if left part is sorted:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);

                // Eliminate left half:
                low = mid + 1;

            } else { //if right part is sorted:

                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[mid]);

                // Eliminate right half:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3};
        int ans = findMin(arr);
        System.out.println("The minimum element is: " + ans );
    }
}
