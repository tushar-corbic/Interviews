Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.



Actually, the problem is the same as "Given a collection of intervals, find the maximum number of intervals that are non-overlapping." (the classic Greedy problem: Interval Scheduling). With the solution to that problem, guess how do we get the minimum number of intervals to remove? : )

Sorting Interval.end in ascending order is O(nlogn), then traverse intervals array to get the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals is O(n). Total is O(nlogn).


    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(Interval[] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0)  return 0;

        Arrays.sort(intervals, new myComparator());
        int end = intervals[0].end;
        int count = 1;        

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i].start >= end) {
                end = intervals[i].end;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return intervals.length - count;
    }
    
    class myComparator implements Comparator<Interval> {
        public int compare(Interval a, Interval b) {
            return a.end - b.end;
        }
    }
