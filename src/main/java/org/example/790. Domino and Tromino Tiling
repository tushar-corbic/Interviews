You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.
Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
class Solution {
    public int numTilings(int n) {
        int mod  =100007;
        int[]dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        if(n==1)
            return dp[1];
        dp[2] = 2;
        if(n==2)
            return dp[2];

        dp[3] = 5;
        if(n==3)
            return dp[n];
        for(int i = 4; i<=n; i++){
            dp[i] = ((dp[i-1]*2)%mod + dp[i-3])%mod;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
