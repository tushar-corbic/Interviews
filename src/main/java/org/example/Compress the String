Compress the String

Problem statement
Ninja has been given a program to do basic string compression. For a character that is consecutively repeated more than once, he needs to replace the consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.

Example:

If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".

The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.
Note :

The consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than or equal to 9.

import java.util.* ;
import java.io.*; 

public class Solution {
	public static String compressTheString(String s) {
		// Write your code here
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		int count =0;
		for(int i =0; i<s.length(); ){
			int j= i+1;
			while(j<s.length() && s.charAt(j)==s.charAt(j-1)){
				// count++;
				j++;
			}
			int cc = j-i;
			if(cc>1){
				sb.append(s.charAt(i));
				sb.append(""+cc);
				i=j;
			}else{
				sb.append(s.charAt(i));
				i=j;
			}
		}
		return sb.toString();
	}

}
