 Count Set Bits 
You are given a positive integer ‘N’. Your task is to find the total number of ‘1’ in the binary representation of all the numbers from 1 to N.

Since the count of ‘1’ can be huge, you are required to return it modulo 1e9+7.
Note:

Do not print anything, just return the number of set bits in the binary representation of all integers between 1 and ‘N’


public class Solution 
{
    public static int countSetBits(int n) 
    {
        //    Write your code here.
        int[]dp = new int[n+1];
        int sum =0;
        for(int i = 1; i<=n; i++){
            dp[i] = dp[i/2] + (i%2);
        }
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            sum = (sum+ dp[i])%1000000007;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
