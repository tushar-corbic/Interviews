Delete Leaf Nodes With Value X
roblem statement
You are given a binary tree, in which the data present in the nodes are integers. You are also given an integer X.

Your task is to delete all the leaf nodes with value X. In the process, if the newly formed leaves also have value X, you have to delete them too.

For example:

For the given binary tree, and X = 3:


/*
    Following is the representation of a Binary Tree Node

    class BinaryTreeNode<T> 
    {
        T data;
        BinaryTreeNode<T> left;
        BinaryTreeNode<T> right;

        public BinaryTreeNode(T data) 
        {
            this.data = data;
        }
    }

*/

public class Solution 
{
    public static BinaryTreeNode<Integer> deleteLeafNodes(BinaryTreeNode<Integer> root, int x) 
    {
        //Your code goes here
        if(root==null)
            return root;
       root.left = deleteLeafNodes(root.left, x);
       root.right = deleteLeafNodes(root.right, x);
       if(root.data==x && root.right==null && root.left==null)
            return null;
        return root;
    }
}
