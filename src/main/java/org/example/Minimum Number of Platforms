Minimum Number of Platforms
You have been given two arrays, 'AT' and 'DT', representing the arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station.

Your task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train needs to wait.

Note :
1. Every train will depart on the same day and the departure time will always be greater than the arrival time. For example, A train with arrival time 2240 and departure time 1930 is not possible.

2. Time will be given in 24H format and colons will be omitted for convenience. For example, 9:05AM will be given as "905", or 9:10PM will be given as "2110".

3. Also, there will be no leading zeroes in the given times. For example, 12:10AM will be given as “10” and not as “0010”.

import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    public static int calculateMinPatforms(int at[], int dt[], int n) {
        // Write your code here.
        int ans = 0;
        Arrays.sort(at);
        Arrays.sort(dt);
        int first = 0;
        int second= 0;
        int n1 = at.length;
        int n2 = dt.length;
        int res = 0;
        while(first<n1 && second<n2){
            if(at[first]<=dt[second]){
                ans++;
                first++;
            }else{
                ans--;
                second++;
            }
                            res = Math.max(res, ans);

        }
        return res;
    }
}
