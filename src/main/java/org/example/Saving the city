Saving the city
The avengers have the responsibility to save the world. To perform this task they have divided their responsibility such that each one takes the responsibility of one city. Mr. Stark aka Iron Man got the responsibility of the city Malibu. The only safe place in the city is the Stark tower. Now, Iron Man has to shift trapped people from different parts of the city to the Stark tower.

But he can only shift one person at a time. Due to less time he wants to take the shortest possible path. Help him to find the minimum distance that he had to cover to rescue all the trapped people.

Note:

1. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid.
2. The positions of people donâ€™t overlap.
3. Iron Man can move only up, down, left, and right to the adjacent cel
