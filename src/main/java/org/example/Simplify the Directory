Simplify the Directory
You are given a path to a file/directory in Unix-style of length N, In a Unix-style file system, a dot(.) refers to the current directory. A double dot(..) refers to the previous directory in reference to the current directory. If there are multiple slashes between two directories you should consider it as a single slash.

Now, for a given directory path as a string, you are required to simplify the same and tell the final destination in the directory structure or the path.

The simplified path should always begin with a slash(/) and there must be a single slash between two directory names. There should not be a trailing slash

import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
	public static String simplifyDirectory(String str) {
		// write your code here
		List<String> temp = new ArrayList<>();
		for(String st : str.split("/")){
			if(st.isEmpty() || st.equals(".")){
				continue;
			}
			if(st.equals("..")){
				if(temp.isEmpty()==false){
					temp.remove(temp.size()-1);
				}
			}else{
				temp.add(st);
			}
		}
		return "/" + String.join("/", temp);
	}

}
